"# olympic-medal-predictions" 

Beginner machine learning algorithm. This is a basic Linear regression model trained to predict the number of olympic medals a country will win. This model works well for countries with a lot of data (countries that have participated more/countries that send in more athletes) but worse for countries with less data.
